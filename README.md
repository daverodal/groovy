Before I made any games I tested out browser responsiveness, 
this program throws around about a dozen blocks in an animated fashion so you can say,   "groovy"......

(it's a bit of a hack)

old php version is not needed.

Just browse to groovy.html, don't need webserver either (do need all supporting files)


but it will make you say. groooooovy.......
